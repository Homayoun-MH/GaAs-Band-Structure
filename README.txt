GaAs-Band-Structure
===================
In the name of God

It was a project written for Quantum Transport course;
Which is based on the following book and it's appendix: 
  "Quantum Transport:Atom to Transistor" by Professor Supriyo Datta.

E(k) is calculated by finding the eigenvalues of the matrix in Eq. (5.3.3) for each value of k
along Gamma–X (that is, from k = 0 to k = 2pi/a * [1 0 0]) and
Gamma–L (that is, from k = 0 to k = pi/a * [1 1 1]) directions.
Some of the lines on the output plot are degenerate.
